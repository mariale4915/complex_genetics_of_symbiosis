This repository archives the data and analyses for two papers:

1) "The complex genetics of symbiotic extended phenotypes across environments in a model mutualism" - bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.03.454976

2) "The genetic basis of cooperation and conflict in natural populations of a model symbiont" - bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.19.452989

## Contents

This repository contains the raw data and analyses for:

### 1) Complex Genetics

This [folder](https://github.com/rtbatstone/complex_genetics_of_symbiosis/tree/master/Complex_genetics) contains the raw data from the four GWAS experiments, the linear model results presented in the main text of the paper, and the code that generated Figures in the main text and Supplemental Figures. 

### 2) Genetics of Conflict and Cooperation

This [folder](https://github.com/rtbatstone/complex_genetics_of_symbiosis/tree/master/Genetics_conflict_cooperation) contains the phenotypic and genomic analyses conducted on two of the four GWAS experiments listed in 1), and the code that generated Figures in the main text and Supplemental Figures.
